1. Write a function that takes a string and a character which is not an alphabet and
   returns a list of all words that start with that character.

   Don't worry about upper case or lower case character.

   For example:
     get_words( "I see oranges in the orchard", "o") will return ["oranges","orchard"]

     get_words("Hi my name is Henry") will return ["Hi", "Henry"]


2. Write code to copy everything from one text file to another.

3. Write a function that can take any number of arguments.
   If I pass some numbers to the function it must return the sum of all those numbers.

   For example:-  
     add_nums( 3, 6, 7)  returns 16

4. Write a function that takes a dictionary as an argument and checks if 
   'name' property exists in the dictionary. If it exists it adds another property called
   has_name as True, otherwise call has_name as False.


5. Create the following classes:

	2 class properties each
	2 instance properties each
	2 methods each.

	Vehicle, Car, BMW 

6. Given a package structure like this.


sound/                          Top-level package
      __init__.py               Initialize the sound package
      formats/                  Subpackage for file format conversions
              __init__.py
              wavread.py
              wavwrite.py
              aiffread.py
              aiffwrite.py
              auread.py
              auwrite.py
              ...
      effects/                  Subpackage for sound effects
              __init__.py
              echo.py
              surround.py
              reverse.py
              ...
      filters/                  Subpackage for filters
              __init__.py
              equalizer.py
              vocoder.py
              karaoke.py


i) How will you import soundbar function from karaoke.py

ii) How will you import the entire echo module.

iii) How will you import wavread and auwrite modules only.
